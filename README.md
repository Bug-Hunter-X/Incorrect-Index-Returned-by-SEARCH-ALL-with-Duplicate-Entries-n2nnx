This repository contains a demonstration of an uncommon error in COBOL when using the SEARCH ALL statement with duplicate entries in a table. The `bug.cob` file showcases the flawed logic, while `bugSolution.cob` provides the corrected code.  The issue stems from `SEARCH ALL` stopping at the *first* match, not necessarily the last or a specific one.  The solution uses a more robust approach to handle duplicates.
